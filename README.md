# Password Generator - JavaScript Week 3 Challenge

## Description

For this module's challenge, we were asked to write code in JavaScript for a random password generator. With this generator, a user can input any length of password 8-128 characters, and choose from lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters to include. Since the passwords generated are random, they would work for a user who wants a secure password that can't easily be guessed, and can work with any system password requirements, since the user specifies what those are.  

I learned a lot writing this code! The main portion was to write the "generatePassword" function that is called in the "writePassword" function that was provided for us in the starter code. There was a lot of trial and error to get to the final result but it was super fun and satisfying to get to the final result! I learned a lot about how to use the concatenation operator / method, the prompt and confirm commands for user inputs, and the math.random function. I also learned a little about event listeners even though we haven't quite gotten there in class yet and that code was provided for us (though I did add an additional event listener to this code).
